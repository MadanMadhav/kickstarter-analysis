# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The Kickstarter data is a collection of several thousand crowdfunding projects. I performed analysis on this data to uncover any hidden trends. To understand the data easily, I filtered and downsized the data at first. Then used pivot tables and charts to analyse data and present it for better visualisation. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
First, the amount of data in the worksheet was really overwhelming. Filtering columns by categories helped me downsize it by a good amount. The filters allowed me to focus only on specific information that I wanted to analyse. Second, applying filters were not enough to uncover trends. This is where pivot tables and charts did wonders for me. They helped me represent information in a more organized and compressed manner. Third, pivot tables do summarise the data well, but they are not the most convenient to put together. For that I had to play around with them to get a hang of using them in the right manner. 

## Results

###What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Firstly, months of May, June and July had the most number of successful outcomes. 
Secondly, failure rate is somewhat constant over all the months. Average failure rate per month is approximately 41. There are not many outliers, most of the points are close to the average. Thirdly, rate of cancellations is constant. Average cancellations per month is approximately 3.083. October is the only month with no cancellations. 

###What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

It can be seen that campaigns with goals of less than 1000 have highest percent of success rate. Therefore, it can be said that campaigns with goals of less than 1000 have the highest probability of being successful. 

###What are some limitations of this dataset?
Goal and pledged columns are in multiple currencies. It would be much easier to analyze the data if all figures were in the same currency. For example, the average donation column could be misleading if each figure is not of the same currency. 

###What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

*We can test if there is any positive/negative relation between the average amount of donation with success/failure rate of meeting the goal of the campaign. For this we could do a regression analysis. The analysis can be visualized with a scatter plot and a trend line. 
*We can also do a comparison between countries and compare them on number of aspects like average donations and number of donations by year. Bar charts would work best to visualize these kinds of comparisons.
